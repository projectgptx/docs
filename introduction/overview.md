# Overview

The field of artificial intelligence, or AI, is currently undergoing an unprecedented period of progress and innovation, particularly with the emergence of powerful language processing models such as GPT. These models have made it possible to develop a wide variety of applications and solutions across different domains and purposes.

Our proposed solution is a unique AI protocol layer that interacts with the ever-expanding AI tool set and adapts to changing landscapes. This algorithm is designed to be&#x20;

* Resilient remains functional even when other platforms and protocols undergo significant changes.&#x20;
* Adaptable ensuring that results remain highly adaptable and usable without losing value.&#x20;
* Versatile takes form, like a liquid, of any AI it integrates with minimal user input

This is the **GPTX** Layer.
