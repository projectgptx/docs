# The AI Landscape

The difficulty to understand and interface with the available tools is not available , we believe, is at its core a user experience problem.&#x20;

Among these challenges that users face include:

* The rapid pace of growth of AI tools can be overwhelming.
* Navigating for the right tool is cumbersome & detracts from achieving the objective.
* No straightforward approach to customizing responses based on the user's profile.
* Absence of centralized location to browse and publish AI apps to.
* Difficult to compete in the AI space.
* Lack of a specific center for investors and entrepreneurs to come together.

Several institutions have adopted AI tools, however, their use has been limited to cleaning up  messaging and generating filler text for documentation and communication. Currently there is no efficient solution available that asks a user how they would like to be assisted.&#x20;
