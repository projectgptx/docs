# Staking

GPTX's ecosystem offers multiple staking and farming options for $GPTX token holders, mainly used to access the AI protocol and farming to earn rewards in $GPTX tokens.

#### Staking: What It Is and How It Works

Staking is a mechanism that allows token holders to earn rewards or certain benefits within an ecosystem by locking up their tokens and contributing to the security and stability of the network. In the case of GPTX, staking enables token holders to access the AI Protocol and receive priority access to its services. To participate in staking, a token holder must lock up a certain number of $GPTX tokens for a set period. This period can vary depending on the specific staking program. The tokens are unavailable for use during this time, but the token holder enjoys each staking program's benefits.
