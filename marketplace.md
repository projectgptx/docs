# ðŸ’¸ Marketplace

As part of its commitment to driving innovation, GPTX is launching a marketplace where individuals and companies can list their AI solutions built using the GPTX protocol. This marketplace will allow businesses to access a diverse range of AI solutions and drive collaboration within the GPTX ecosystem.

A marketplace that lists solutions provided using the GPTX protocol will be a platform for AI developers to showcase their products and services that are built on top of the GPTX protocol. This marketplace would allow developers to reach a wider audience and potential customers who are interested in using AI tools for their businesses and sell their solution for their own reward.

The GPTX protocol being a layer 2 AI protocol means that it provides a unified interface to access multiple AI tools, making it easier and more efficient for developers to integrate AI into their products and services. This, in turn, enables the development of real-world applications that leverage the power of AI and can improve productivity and efficiency across a range of industries.

By having a marketplace that lists solutions developed using the GPTX protocol, it can encourage more developers to build on top of the protocol, which can help grow the ecosystem and drive innovation in the AI space.
